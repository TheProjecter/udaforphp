#summary What we aim to do.

= Project Goals =

UDA4PHP is meant to be a library that provides a uniform interface for accessing database systems from PHP. The idea is to create a core library to which DBMS vendors can then interface through an arbitrary number of drivers, thus providing a single entry point for all data access.

The goal of UDA4PHP is _not_ to provide database abstraction, but to provide database access abstraction.

= Roadmap to Version 1.0 =

There are several steps that we have identified as a roadmap to completing the library:

 # *Agree on a CLA*—this is currently [ClaDiscussion in progress].
 # *Agree on functionality constraints*—we need to decide _what_ we want the library to do.
 # *Design the library*—based on our technical objectives, we will design the overall library.
 # *Write the library*—clearly the easiest part :-)
 # *Write a driver*—we should probably decide on a reference implementation for a driver
 # *Write the documentation*—for both driver designers and users
